You need to develop a small page using adaptive layout.
There is no need to create any backend architecture or integrate the page into Python code:
just create an HTML page that can be opened in a browser.
The goal is to make it beautiful, concise and informative.
tell a potential employer about yourself and layout this story so that it opens up and
was readable on supported devices. Be sure to use photographs.
